## Sports Player Generator

I needed to generate some data for an app I'm working on (which is related to sports :))

Started to put together a python code (might turn it into an api) that'll eventually give you a .csv file with all the generated info.

Currently the name generator part is done, and just some basic functionality.

My current goal is to create a basketball player generator - still figuring out how to create realistic data, currently the numbers are hard coded.

In the future I'd like to add the option to choose a sport so you can get the relevant data for it.



#### Current To-Do's:

1. Arrange the code files - split the functions into relevant pages,
   - The name generator will be similar for everyone, so it can be split up.
2. Finish the basketball player model - without realistic numbers.
   - might want to add a few properties.
3. Implement the .csv export function.
4. Implement the option to choose the amount of players generated via the command line.
5. Define the requirements to create new sport models.
6. Rework this README.md file.



#### This is an open source project!

If you'd like to help me and work on this project or you have a cool idea you would like me to implement, just open an issue, fork the project or contact me :)
